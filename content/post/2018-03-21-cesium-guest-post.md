### Do you want to learn how to use time animations in CesiumJS?
---
Head over to the [Cesium Blog](https://cesium.com/blog/2018/03/21/czml-time-animation/) to read my guest post.

The article is a step-by-step tutorial on how to easily use [CZML](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer/wiki/CZML-Guide), the CesiumJS data-driven interface to incorporate time dynamic animations in your own applications. The tutorial draws from an example implemented in the [OregonHOWL](https://oregonhowl.org/) site, used to animate Oregon's [history of wildfires](https://oregonhowl.org/?view=wildfires).

I am delighted to announce that I will be presenting [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com) at the 2016 FOSS4GNA conference in Raleigh, North Carolina. The conference runs from May 2-6, and my presentation is scheduled Tuesday, May 3, at 5:20pm in Room 7.

[Here](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/session/visualizing-gps-tracks-rikitraki) is the abstract I proposed and below are the draft presentation slides:

</p>

Since it will be a short session, I will definitely need to make some serious adjustments to the content. It will be challenging to select key items that would be the most useful and interesting to my audience... I am really looking forward to the opportunity!

I would like to thank the conference committee for inviting me to participate in such a prestigious event. I would also like to thank the folks over at [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) for encouraging me to submit a proposal.

### See you in Raleigh...

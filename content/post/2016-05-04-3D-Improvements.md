### Latest [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com) 3D Visualization improvements

---
This is just a brief post summarizing a few improvements I implemented recently on the 3D visualization part.

<!--more-->

* Parity with the 2D visualization

	* Added track information box
	* Added displaying geopositioned thumbnails
	* Added layer control

* Seamless (i.e., no page reloads) track-to-track, track-to-globe, and globe-to-track navigation

* Browser Back and Forward without reload

On my [next entry](/post/2016-05-07-foss4gna-update) I will post my [FOSS4G-NA](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/) presentation materials.

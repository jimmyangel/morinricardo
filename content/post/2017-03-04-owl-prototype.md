### So what is [this](http://morinricardo.com/howl-proto/)?

It is a collection of prototypes for visualizing Oregon wild lands and related information (e.g., old growth forests, clearcuts, wildfires) using the web-based [Cesium.js](https://cesiumjs.org/) virtual globe and map engine and data from multiple sources.

This is just the beginning of a project I will be developing incrementally in collaboration with the [Oregon Wild](http://oregonwild.org/) folks. I will be enhancing this tool to incorporate additional data sets related to Oregon Wilderness areas and turning it into an interactive web application that will enable users select and combine multiple information layers and run time-based animations to show interesting changes over time and geography.

I am really excited about this project. Stay tuned!

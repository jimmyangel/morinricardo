Hi! My name is Ricardo Morin and this is my blog. I am currently developing [HOWL](https://oregonhowl.org), Highlighting Oregon's Wild Lands. I also created [RikiTraki](https://www.rikitraki.com), a GPS track sharing site. My interests include all kinds of geekery related to web development, both client and server side, web mapping and geographical information systems. I am an avid hiker, which is the reason I started RikiTraki in the first place. I also love latin music, especially Cuban genres such as Son, Timba and Salsa, and I enjoy dancing casino-style salsa.

In my blog, I will discuss HOWL and RikiTraki, but I will likely include all kinds of rants as well.

### More Information

I live in beautiful Portland, Oregon. I used to work for [Intel Corporation](http://intel.com) and I retired in March, 2015. I am now freelancing and doing my own stuff.

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and immigrated to these great United States of America in 1986.

I am married to [Hilde](http://www.hildemorin.com), my favorite artist. You should check her stuff out. It is really amazing.
